**Purpose**: Demonstrate all modules working together

**Time**: 30 minutes

---

## Week 1: Viscosity Prediction (High Priority) ðŸ”´

### Goal
Implement SAP score and Developability Index for high-concentration mAb formulation.

### Background
- **Problem**: mAbs at >100 mg/mL can have high viscosity (>20 cP)
- **Impact**: Prevents subcutaneous injection (need <20 cP)
- **Frequency**: 30-40% of mAbs have viscosity issues

### Implementation

**File to create**: `etrial/developability/viscosity.py`

**Algorithms to implement**:

1. **SAP (Spatial Aggregation Propensity)**
   - Sharma et al. (2014) PNAS
   - Surface patch analysis
   - Score = net charge Ã— hydrophobic surface area

2. **Developability Index**
   - Raybould et al. (2019) mAbs
   - Combines multiple factors:
     - pI (isoelectric point)
     - PSR (patch surface ratio)
     - Fv charge symmetry
     - Hydrophobic patches

3. **Charge Symmetry Parameter**
   - Tomar et al. (2016) mAbs
   - Asymmetric charge distribution â†’ higher viscosity

**Key Metrics**:
- `sap_score` < 20 = PASS
- `developability_index` > 0 = PASS
- `charge_symmetry_parameter` < 0.3 = PASS

**Effort**: 5-7 days
- Day 1-2: Implement SAP score
- Day 3-4: Implement Developability Index
- Day 5: Charge symmetry
- Day 6-7: Testing + integration

**Test cases needed**:
- Known low-viscosity mAb (adalimumab)
- Known high-viscosity mAb (requires redesign)

---

## Week 2: Computational Alanine Scanning ðŸŸ¡

### Goal
Identify binding hotspots for affinity maturation.

### Background
- **Purpose**: Predict which residues contribute most to binding
- **Use case**: Guide mutations for affinity improvement
- **Method**: Calculate Î”Î”G for Ala substitutions

### Implementation

**File to create**: `etrial/structure/alanine_scanning.py`

**Approaches**:

1. **FoldX Integration** (preferred)
   - Install FoldX
   - Run BuildModel for each Ala mutation
   - Calculate Î”Î”G_binding
   - Hotspots: Î”Î”G > 2 kcal/mol

2. **Simple Energy-Based** (fallback)
   - Count H-bonds lost
   - Estimate buried SASA change
   - Approximate Î”Î”G from empirical rules

**Key Metrics**:
- `num_hotspots` - Count of critical residues
- `hotspot_positions` - List of positions
- `avg_delta_g` - Average contribution

**Effort**: 5-7 days
- Day 1-2: Install + test FoldX
- Day 3-4: Implement scanning logic
- Day 5: Fallback energy method
- Day 6-7: Testing + validation

**Test cases needed**:
- Known antibody-antigen complex
- Experimental alanine scan data for validation

## Week 3: PROPKA pH Stability ðŸŸ¡

### Goal
Predict stability at different pH values (critical for formulation).

### Background
- **Problem**: Proteins unstable at certain pH ranges
- **Impact**: Must choose formulation pH where stable
- **Method**: Predict pKa shifts, identify pH-labile residues

### Implementation

**File to create**: `etrial/developability/ph_stability.py`

**Approach**:

1. **PROPKA Integration** (preferred)
   - Install PROPKA 3.5
   - Calculate pKa for all ionizable residues
   - Identify buried charged residues (unstable)

2. **Simple Electrostatic** (fallback)
   - Count buried Asp/Glu/His/Lys/Arg
   - Estimate pKa shifts based on environment
   - Flag residues with large shifts

**Key Metrics**:
- `stable_ph_range` - pH range where stable

## Week 4: NetMHCpan MHC-I Epitopes ðŸŸ¡

### Goal
Add CD8 T-cell epitope prediction (complement existing MHC-II).

### Background
- **Current**: Only have MHC-II (CD4 T-cells)
- **Missing**: MHC-I (CD8 T-cells)
- **Impact**: More complete immunogenicity assessment

### Implementation

**File to create**: `etrial/immunogenicity/mhc1_epitopes.py`

**Approach**:

1. **NetMHCpan Integration** (preferred)
   - Install NetMHCpan 4.1
   - Predict binding to HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C
   - Report strong binders (percentile rank < 2%)

2. **Pattern-Based** (fallback)
   - Known MHC-I binding motifs
   - Hydrophobicity + anchor residue patterns
   - Less accurate but fast

**Key Metrics**:
- `mhc1_epitope_count` - Number of strong binders
- `hla_coverage` - % of population with epitopes
- `epitope_positions` - List of positions

**Effort**: 3-4 days

## Priority Matrix

### Must Do (Weeks 1-4)
âœ… **Integrate QC modules** (today)
ðŸ”´ **Viscosity prediction** (week 1) - Prevents costly formulation failures
ðŸŸ¡ **Alanine scanning** (week 2) - Enables rational design
ðŸŸ¡ **PROPKA** (week 3) - Critical for formulation
ðŸŸ¡ **NetMHCpan** (week 4) - Completes immunogenicity

### Should Do (Months 2-3)
ðŸŸ¢ Experimental validation
ðŸŸ¢ Threshold optimization
ðŸŸ¢ Production hardening
ðŸŸ¢ CI/CD setup

### Nice to Have (Future)
âšª MD simulations (for finalists only)
âšª Docking (AlphaFold already does this)
âšª Active learning pipeline
âšª Web interface

---

## Decision Points

### After Week 1
**Question**: Is viscosity prediction accurate enough?
- If YES: Continue to alanine scanning
- If NO: Spend extra week improving (get more training data)

### After Week 2
**Question**: Can we install FoldX?
- If YES: Use FoldX for accurate Î”Î”G
- If NO: Use fallback energy method (less accurate but functional)

### After Week 4
**Question**: All quick wins complete - what's next?
- Option A: Validation (recommended) - ensures accuracy
- Option B: Production hardening - deploy faster
- Option C: More features - diminishing returns

**Recommendation**: Choose Option A (validation) to ensure quality before deployment.

## Risk Management

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1**: Can't install external tools (FoldX, PROPKA, NetMHCpan)
- **Mitigation**: Implemented fallback methods for all
- **Impact**: Reduced accuracy (70% vs 85%) but still functional

**Risk 2**: Validation shows poor accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Tune thresholds, add more training data
- **Impact**: Extra 1-2 weeks for improvements

**Risk 3**: Performance too slow
- **Mitigation**: Profile and optimize, add caching
- **Impact**: Extra 1 week for optimization

**Risk 4**: Scope creep (too many features)
- **Mitigation**: Stick to 7 quick wins only, defer rest to Phase 2
- **Impact**: Controlled timeline

## Questions to Answer

Before starting Week 1:

1. **Do we have access to experimental viscosity data for validation?**
   - If not, where can we get it? (ChEMBL, literature, etc.)

2. **What is the target threshold for viscosity?**
   - Industry standard: <20 cP for subcutaneous injection
   - <10 cP preferred

3. **Should we focus on mAbs only or all biologics?**
   - SAP score is mAb-specific
   - Can extend to other biologics later

4. **What is the performance target?**
   - Current: 40ms pre-filter
   - With viscosity: Aim for <60ms
